# Birdhouse Shoe Box

I made a shoe box! I plan to put it on my balcony to protect my balcony slippers from the rain and dust. The slanted lid, which resembles the roof of a birdhouse, allows rain to drip down instead of accumulating on top of the box.

To make the shoe box, I first scrapped out some material. I found a 6-inch x 7/8 inch yellow pine lumber and some pieces of plywood from the pile. The plywood pieces have grooves on them already from their original project.

Fun fact: the yellow pine boards are originally from the old floorings in MIT Building 4, and the plywood boards are from the cabinets in the student center.

I first made the front and back panels with yellow pine, where I glued the side-grains together.

To account for the slanted lid, I made one side of them slanted with a table saw. Since I planned to use dadoes to hold the bottom panel, I then cut the grooves for the dadoes with a half-inch router.

I also cut some rabbets on the yellow pine panels so that the joints are stronger. I then slid the bottom panel in and glued everything together.

I also cut a strip of yellow pine as an inlay on the existing grooves of the lid.

I then chiseled some space for the hinges, and used the hinges to connect the lid and the box.

Now the box is ready. :)
